= A demo of Zurb-Foundation

This is a class assignment to follow RailsCast #417 to generate a basic rails site and style it using (zurb-foundation)[https://github.com/zurb/foundation].

== To set up and run this demo, run the following:

`git clone https://github.com/vogelbek/zurb-demo.git

Make sure you are in the new project directory

`bundle

`rake db:migrate

`rails server

I did deviate slightly from the Rails Cast by routing the root to the index page of interest. This is for your convenience only.
